# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This repository hosts my personal website and blog.  

While it is a public project, it is not a public debate forum.

This Code of Conduct exists to set clear expectations for respectful interaction in issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## Expected Behavior

All contributors and visitors are expected to:

- Communicate respectfully and in good faith  
- Provide constructive feedback if offering suggestions  
- Stay on topic and relevant to the repository  
- Respect boundaries set by the maintainer  

Kindness and clarity are valued here.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not allowed:

- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks  
- Hate speech or discriminatory language  
- Repeated unsolicited refactoring or large structural changes  
- Attempting to derail conversations  
- Spam or promotional content  
- Submitting malicious or intentionally disruptive code  

This repository is not a space for ideological debate, hostility, or provocation.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome at the maintainer’s discretion.

Please note:

- This is a personal site, not a community-driven software project.
- Pull requests may be declined without obligation to provide detailed justification.
- Large changes should not be submitted without prior discussion.

## Moderation & Enforcement

The maintainer reserves the right to:

- Edit or remove comments
- Close issues or pull requests
- Block users engaging in disruptive behavior
- Limit or disable interactions if necessary

These actions may be taken without prior warning if conduct is clearly harmful.

## Reporting

If you believe there has been a violation of this Code of Conduct, please open an issue clearly labeled "CoC Concern" or contact the maintainer directly.

All reports will be reviewed at the maintainer’s discretion.

## Final Note

This is a personal project built for creativity, learning, and documentation.  
If you are here in good faith, you are welcome.

If you are here to disrupt, you will not be.
