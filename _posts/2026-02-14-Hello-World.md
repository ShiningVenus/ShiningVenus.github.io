## 🌙 Welcome to Moonlock

Hi, I’m really glad you’re here.

This is my personal site and blog, a space where I can build, write, and think out loud without algorithms or timelines rushing me along. It’s part dev log, part creative archive, part quiet corner of the internet.

Here you’ll find:

- Notes from projects and server experiments
- Reflections on community and online spaces
- Character lore and creative writing
- Structured ND friendly posts that are easy to navigate

This space exists because I wanted something slower. Something permanent. A place where ideas can grow without disappearing into a feed.

It won’t always be polished, but it will always be real.

Welcome to my little archive of starlight and code. ✨
