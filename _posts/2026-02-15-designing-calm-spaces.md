The modern internet is a bit much as feeds move fast. Notifications compete for attention, and everything pushes urgency.

When I started rebuilding my personal site, I realized I did not want to recreate that environment. I wanted something slower and structured. A calm space is not an accident. It is designed.

## Boundaries Are Not Hostility

Adding a Code of Conduct is not about expecting bad behavior at all to me. To me it's more about setting expectations clearly. When boundaries are written down, they remove ambiguity and they reduce emotional labor later. They create safety before conflict ever appears.

## Static by Design

This site runs as a static build. No heavy backend, no database to babysit, and no complicated deployment pipeline.

That simplicity is part of the calm. Fewer moving parts means fewer things to break, fewer things to monitor, and fewer things to stress about. Minimal infrastructure creates maximum mental clarity.

## Comments Intentionally

I enabled comments through GitHub Discussions.

That means:
- No anonymous drive-by posting
- No third-party ad networks
- No hidden tracking ecosystem

It adds friction. Good conversations survive small friction.

## Small Over Big

If this site grows, that is fine. If it stays small, that is also fine.

Not everything needs scale. Some spaces are better when they remain intentional. This blog is an archive, not an algorithm.

And I am building it to last.
