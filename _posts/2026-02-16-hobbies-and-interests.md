People sometimes ask what I like and am into!

## 🎮 Games (Old and New)

I love video games specially ones with atmosphere, story, or strong identity.

There’s something about older console eras that still hits differently. Physical discs and menu sounds. UI design that had personality. I enjoy collecting and revisiting those experiences as much as playing them.

Modern games are great too, but nostalgia carries weight. Games are comfort, creativity, and sometimes escape.

## ✨ Anime & Manga

Magical girls, emotional arcs, character growth. I’m drawn to stories where characters evolve, struggle, and choose kindness anyway.

I care a lot about character writing. Motivations, unternal conflicts, and growth over time.

Those themes bleed into how I roleplay and how I think about storytelling in general.

## 🛠 Building Things Online

I genuinely enjoy building digital spaces.

Static sites, forums, themeing, etc.

There’s something satisfying about owning your corner of the internet and shaping it intentionally.


## 🧠 Community & Moderation

This might sound strange as a “hobby” but I enjoy thinking about how communities function.

What makes a space healthy?  
How do boundaries shape tone?  
What makes people feel welcome versus overwhelmed?

Designing structure feels creative to me.

## 📓 Writing & Roleplay

I like long form writing and character development.

Roleplay lets stories breathe in a collaborative way that most platforms don’t support anymore.
